# xiuh - Generic ERP models and tools

## Origin of the name

The Xiuhp≈çhualli was one of the Aztec calendars.  It was used by the Nahuatl
peoples in the pre-Columbian era.  It was used to track the solar year (which
is why it was based on 365 days) and was crucial for determining planting and
harvesting seasons.
